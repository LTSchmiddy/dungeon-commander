While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: _burning hands_ (1 charge), _fireball_ (3 charges), or _wall of fire_ (4 charges).\n\nThe staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.",
