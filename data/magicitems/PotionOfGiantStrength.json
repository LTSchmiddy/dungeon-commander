The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.\n\nThis potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The _potion of frost giant strength_ and the _potion of stone giant strength_ have the same effect.\n\n| Type of Giant     | Strength | Rarity    |\n|-------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Hill giant        | 21       | Uncommon  |\n| Frost/stone giant | 23       | Rare      |\n| Fire giant        | 25       | Rare      |\n| Cloud giant       | 27       | Very rare |\n| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |",
