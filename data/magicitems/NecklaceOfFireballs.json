    "description": "This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level _fireball_ spell (save DC 15).\n\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the _fireball_ by 1 for each bead beyond the first.",
