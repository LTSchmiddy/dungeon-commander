    "description": "This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\n\nYou can use an action to unfold and place the _well of many worlds_ on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once _well of many worlds_ has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.",
