The sathaq worm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the sathaq worm takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sathaq worm must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the sathaq worm. If the sathaq worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.",
