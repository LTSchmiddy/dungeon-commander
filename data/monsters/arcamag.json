Instead, it causes a handful of changes in its spellcaster host (see Changes to the Host sidebar). The arcamag can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature other than the host can use its action to detach the arcamag by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The host can use its action to detach the arcamag only after the host has expended all of its spell slots for the day, including the extra cantrips and spell slots gained from having the arcamag attached. Doing so doesn't require a Strength check. When the arcamag detaches itself or is detached from a host, the host takes 2 (1d4) psychic damage per spellcaster level.",
