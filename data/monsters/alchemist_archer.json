The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) acid damage and is restrained by sticky, alchemical goo. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 16 Strength check, bursting through the goo on a success. The goo can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; immunity to piercing, slashing, poison, and psychic damage).\nExplosive. The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) fire damage and catches on fire, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
