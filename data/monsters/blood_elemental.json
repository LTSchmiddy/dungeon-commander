The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time.\n\nAt the start of the elemental's turn, each target grappled by it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing a grappled creature on a success.
