An alabaster tree can have only one creature engulfed at a time.\n\nIf the alabaster tree takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from the engulfed creature, the alabaster tree must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or release the creature in a shower of shredded leaves. The released creature falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the alabaster tree.
