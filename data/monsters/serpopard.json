If the save succeeds, the creature moves to the nearest empty space outside the cone; if the saving throw fails, the creature becomes drenched in musk. A creature that enters the area of the cone while the musk persists is saturated automatically. A creature saturated in musk is poisoned. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a saturated creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. Serpopard musk (and the poisoning) wear off naturally in 1d4 hours. A saturated creature can end the effect early by spending 20 minutes thoroughly washing itself, its clothes, and its equipment with water and soap.",
