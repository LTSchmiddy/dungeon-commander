If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is surrounded by a shadowy aura for 1 minute. While surrounded by the aura, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage when hit by the scimitar attack of a shadow skeleton. Any creature can take an action to extinguish the shadow with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The shadow also extinguishes if the target receives magical healing.",
