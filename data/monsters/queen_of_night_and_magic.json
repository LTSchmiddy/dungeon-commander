All bright light sources in the lair shed only dim light to their normal bright light radius, and dim light sources are extinguished. This lasts until the Queen dismisses the effect or dies.\n\n- An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen.

Creatures in the wall's space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semimaterial shadow resists intrusion. For every foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, any creature that, during its own turn, occupies any part of the wall's space takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, or until she dies.\n\n- The Queen targets one creature within 60 feet of her and assails its mind with visions of hopelessness and despair.
