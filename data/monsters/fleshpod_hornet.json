On a failed saving throw, the target is also infected with the eggs of the fleshpod hornet. \n\nThe injected eggs form a circular lotus pod tumor, roughly half a foot in diameter, on the target within 1 minute of injection. While carrying this tumor, the target has disadvantage on skill checks and saving throws. Exactly 24 hours after the lotus pod appears, a young fleshpod hornet (use giant wasp statistics) erupts from the tumor, dealing does 33 (6d10) slashing damage to the target. \n\nThe tumor can be excised with a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, causing 16 (3d10) slashing damage to the host.
