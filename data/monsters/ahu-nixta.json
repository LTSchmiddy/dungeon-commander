In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta's body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can't be used for combat. The ahu-nixta's extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor.\n\nThe ahu-nixta can exit or enter its clockwork armor as a bonus action.",
