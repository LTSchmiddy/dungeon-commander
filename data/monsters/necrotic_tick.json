Instead, at the start of each of the tick's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hp due to blood loss. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it is affected by the tick's toxins and doesn't attempt to remove the tick. The host will even replace a dislodged tick unless prevented from doing so for 1 minute, after which the tick's influence fades. \n\nThe tick can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so when seeking a new host or if the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the tick. When a necrotic tick detaches, voluntarily or otherwise, its host takes 1 necrotic damage.",
