Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. In addition, the skin bat attaches itself to the target. The skin bat can't bite a different creature while it's attached, and its bite attack automatically hits a creature the skin bat is attached to. Removing a skin bat requires a successful DC 11 Strength check and inflicts 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage to the creature the bat is being removed from. A successful save renders the target immune to skin bat poison for 24 hours.",
