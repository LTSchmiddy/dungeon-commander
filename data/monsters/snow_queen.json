The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in the wall's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

A creature that touches the wall at any time takes the same damage. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Snow Queen uses this action again, or she dies.\n\n- Icy wind and stinging snow swirls around the Snow Queen. All creatures that aren't immune to cold damage have disadvantage when making saving throws against cold damage or cold-based effects while within 60 feet of the Snow Queen. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n\n- The snow and ice of the lair shimmer and gleam, catching the light and flashing it into the eyes of the Snow Queen's foes.
