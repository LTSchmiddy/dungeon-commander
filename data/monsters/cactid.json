Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the target is neither undead nor a construct, the cactid drains the target's body fluids; at the start of each of the target's turns, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 3 (1d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest and drinks abundant water or until it receives a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.
