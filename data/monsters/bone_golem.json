Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to attack until it is destroyed or it regains all its hp. \n\nThe golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk.
