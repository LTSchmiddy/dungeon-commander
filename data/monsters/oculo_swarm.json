This blindness lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in the same space as the oculus; it ends at the end of the blinded creature's turn if the creature is out of the oculus's space. Also, any cure spell cast on the blinded creature ends the temporary blindness, but not restoration spells. If a creature that's already temporarily blinded is targeted again by eye extraction and fails the saving throw, that creature becomes permanently blind as its eyes are pulled from their sockets to join the swarm (causing 1d8 piercing damage). Success on either saving throw renders that creature immune to eye extraction for 24 hours (but it still doesn't recover its sight until it gets out of the swarm). An oculo swarm with 50 or fewer hit points can't use this ability.",
