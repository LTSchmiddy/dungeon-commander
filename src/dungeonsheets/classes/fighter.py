    longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is
    adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
    certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapon_list at once, and some on
    augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization
    makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

    dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or
    she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewardsâ€”few fighters in the city watch have
